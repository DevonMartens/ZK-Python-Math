# R1CS for Polynomial Function: A Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for computing and verifying a Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) for a specific polynomial function, utilizing Python for the implementation. The target function for this exercise is:

    ```python
    fn main(x: field, y: field) -> field {
        return 5*x**3 - 4*y**2*x**2 + 13*x*y**2 + x**2 - 10*y
    }
    ```

# Introduction
R1CS is a set of linear constraints used to express computations. It's particularly useful in cryptographic constructs like zero-knowledge proofs, enabling efficient verification of complex computations.

### Steps Overview

Identify Intermediate Variables: Break down the given function into components manageable within an R1CS framework.

Define Constraints: Translate the function and its components into a series of linear constraints.

Setup R1CS Matrices: Populate the matrices A, B, and C that embody the constraints of the R1CS.

Verify R1CS: Implement a Python script to verify the correctness of the R1CS solution given a witness vector.

# Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Identify Intermediate Variables

To simplify the function's representation, we define intermediate variables for non-linear terms:

    z1 = x^2
    z2 = x^3
    z3 = y^2
    z4 = y^2 * x^2
    z5 = x * y^2

### Step 2: Define Constraints

Based on the intermediate variables, establish the following constraints:

    x * x = z1 for x^2
    x * z1 = z2 for x^3
    y * y = z3 for y^2
    z1 * z3 = z4 for y^2 * x^2
    x * z3 = z5 for x * y^2

Combine all to match the original function's output.

### Step 3: Setup R1CS Matrices

Construct matrices A, B, and C for each constraint:

Matrix A captures the first component of each multiplication.
Matrix B represents the second component.
Matrix C denotes the product/result of the components.
Example for x * x = z1:

    A: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (representing x)
    B: Same as A (since it's x * x)
    C: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (representing z1)

### Step 4: Verify R1CS

Implement the verification in Python, ensuring that for a given witness vector w, the equation Aw * Bw = Cw holds true.

    ```python
    def verify_r1cs(A, B, C, w):
        lhs = np.dot(A, w) * np.dot(B, w)
        rhs = np.dot(C, w)
        return np.allclose(lhs, rhs)
    ```

Use this function to test if the constructed R1CS correctly represents the polynomial function given specific values of x and y in the witness vector w.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can construct and verify an R1CS for a given polynomial function, facilitating a deeper understanding of how computations are represented and verified within cryptographic frameworks.
